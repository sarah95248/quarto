My name is Sarah Belcher, and I'm a senior at UMass Amherst studying biology. Formerly a pre-med student, I have recently shifted my interests to nursing. After I graduate from UMass Amherst this spring, I will be attending an accelerated nursing program to get my bachelor's in nursing. My goal in the future is to get my master's and become a nurse practitioner.
